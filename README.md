1. Get output of the Main class to a text file `java Main > output.txt`
2. Compile Check.java. `javac Check.java`
3. Run the Check. `java Check < output.txt`

If "Successful" is printed at the end, it passed the test. If it stops before that, it failed. The last line it printed is the reason for the failiure.
